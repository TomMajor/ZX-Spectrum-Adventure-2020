Retro Computing: Rebuilding my first home computer some 30 years later (ULA free)

## This project

The Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K was my first home computer back in the 1980s. It was Z80 CPU-based and I just loved it and learned a lot from it.<br><br>
In spring 2020 I learned by chance about Chris Smith genius book [The ZX Spectrum ULA: How to Design a Microcomputer](https://www.amazon.com/Christopher-David-Smith/dp/0956507107), acquired and read it.<br>
In it he describes his reverse engineering of this *mysterious* ULA (Uncommitted Logic Array) chip and explains in great detail all of its functions.<br><br>
Chris also developed the Harlequin, a ZX Spectrum 48K clone based on parts that replace the ULA, so this chip is not needed anymore.<br>
Complete in 2008, it is the first 100% timing compatible clone.<br>
ZX Spectrum fans continued on this development which resulted in the design that is now known as the ‘Harlequin Superfo’. The current Rev G is the most stable one.<br><br>
When I read all about this, I could not resist and decided in July 2020 to rebuild the ZX Spectrum, just for the fun of it.<br>
This will be a low priority project of mine, I plan to have it working maybe in a couple of months.<br>
